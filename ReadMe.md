- re (part of Pythonâ€™s standard library)
### You can install the required packages using pip:

- pip install requests beautifulsoup4
## Usage/Examples

```python
# Import the TimeandDate class
from timeanddate_weather_scraper import TimeandDate

# Instantiate the class with the URL of the desired location's weather page
weather = TimeandDate('https://www.timeanddate.com/weather/uk/london')

# Access weather attributes
print("Temperature:", weather.temperature)
print("Feels Like:", weather.feels_like)
print("Forecast:", weather.forecast)
print("Visibility:", weather.visibility)
print("Pressure:", weather.pressure)
print("Humidity:", weather.humidity)
print("Dew Point:", weather.dew_point)
print("Wind:", weather.wind)
```
```
Output:
Temperature: 15 Â°C
Feels Like: 14 Â°C
Forecast: 19 Â°C to 13 Â°C
Visibility: 10 km
